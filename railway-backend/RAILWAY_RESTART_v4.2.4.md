# RAILWAY EMERGENCY RESTART v4.2.4

## Critical Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ **Railway.toml** - Proper healthcheck configuration
2. ✅ **Procfile** - Web process definition  
3. ✅ **Enhanced /health endpoint** - Fast response optimized
4. ✅ **Improved logging** - Railway-specific diagnostics
5. ✅ **Server binding** - 0.0.0.0 for Railway compatibility

## Health Endpoints:
- `GET /` - Root health check
- `GET /health` - Main healthcheck (Railway monitors this)
- `GET /api/health` - API health check

## Expected Result:
Railway should successfully deploy and pass healthcheck within 300 seconds.
